This sets the stage for fragility. Step 2: The patient's fall is the proverbial straw—minor in itself—but the already compromised bone, like a brittle twig, snaps under this minimal stress. Step 3: The fractured femoral neck is not from trauma alone but a pathological fracture, analogous to a tree branch breaking under its own weight in a storm, not the wind. Step 4: Steroids suppress osteoblast activity while boosting osteoclasts, creating a bone remodeling imbalance akin to a leaky roof (loss) versus a clogged gutter (gain) in home maintenance. Step 5: The diagnosis hinges on recognizing steroid-induced osteoporosis as the underlying condition, much like diagnosing a house's structural weakness after a wall cracks, rather than blaming the weather. Step 6: Treatment requires addressing the root cause (steroid-related bone loss) with bisphosphonates or calcium, similar to reinforcing a weakened foundation to prevent further collapse. Step 7: This case mirrors a car tire on a nail—driving (activity) may cause a leak (fracture), but the nail (steroid use) was the initial vulnerability."
