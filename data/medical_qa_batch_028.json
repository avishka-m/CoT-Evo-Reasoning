          "The patient's chronic COPD is like a smoldering fire, but new symptoms like weight loss and fever suggest a more insidious process. Active tuberculosis (TB) is a slow-burning infection that often masquerades as COPD exacerbation, especially in immunocompromised or elderly patients.",
          "Apical fibronodular opacities on chest X-ray are the 'breadcrumb trail' of TB, similar to a tree shedding bark in layers—these lesions represent granulomas and cavitation typical of reactivated TB in the upper lung zones.",
          "Purulent sputum in TB is akin to a wound that won't heal—chronic inflammation leads to necrosis and cavitation, mixing with lung secretions to create thick, yellow-green sputum.",
          "Weight loss and low-grade fever are the body's 'alarm bells' for chronic infection. Unlike COPD, TB triggers systemic inflammation that depletes energy stores and raises temperature, much like a feverish fight against a persistent invader.",
          "The 5-week duration is a red flag: TB is a slow-acting infection, while bacterial pneumonia usually flares acutely. This timeline suggests a stealthy pathogen like *M. tuberculosis*, which evades the immune system for months before revealing itself."
