          "The healthcare worker’s anxiety mirrors a smoke alarm—while not the fire itself, it signals the need for urgent action to extinguish a potential threat.",
          "Initiating PEP within 72 hours is like locking the door after the horse has left the stable: better late than never, but most effective when done swiftly.",
          "Neglecting PEP in this scenario is analogous to ignoring a vaccination for a preventable disease—both represent missed opportunities to avert lifelong consequences."

Just as a silent engine runs without visible smoke, HIV can progress without symptoms, making routine screening during pregnancy critical. Detecting HIV at 20 weeks is akin to catching a wildfire early; timely intervention with antiretroviral therapy can reduce maternal viral load, much like firefighters contain a blaze before it spreads. Managing this case requires a multidisciplinary approach, similar to a relay race where obstetricians, infectious disease specialists, and neonatologists pass the baton to ensure optimal outcomes. Antiretroviral treatment acts as a shield, protecting the fetus from viral transmission during pregnancy, labor, and delivery, much like a protective barrier in a high-risk environment. Finally, counseling the patient about lifelong treatment adherence is like providing a roadmap—guided properly, it leads to a destination of sustained health and prevents transmission."
