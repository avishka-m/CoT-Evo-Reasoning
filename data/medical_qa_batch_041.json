          "A 45-year-old HIV-positive man with low CD4 counts is like a weakened garden vulnerable to invasive weeds—cryptococcus is one such weed that flourishes in immunosuppressed soil. The two-week history of symptoms suggests a fungal infection rather than acute bacterial processes. Neck stiffness and fever mirror bacterial meningitis, but the subacute onset fits fungal patterns. Cryptococcal meningitis often mimics a slow-growing vine, causing pressure on the brain over days to weeks. The alert but slow mental status contrasts with the rapid confusion seen in bacterial cases, aligning with cryptococcal's subtler, creeping nature."
