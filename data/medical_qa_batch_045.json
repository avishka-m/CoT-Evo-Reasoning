          "In tension pneumothorax, air trapped in the pleural space under positive pressure collapses the lung and pushes the mediastinum away, explaining the absent breath sounds on the left and tracheal deviation to the right.",
          "Alternative diagnoses like a large pleural effusion or complete lung collapse from mucus plugging could cause absent breath sounds but typically do not cause contralateral tracheal deviation in such an acute setting; effusions usually shift the trachea contralaterally only if massive and chronic, and mucus plugging does not shift the trachea.",

          "The absence of breath sounds on the left side is akin to a radio with no signal, indicating a lack of air movement in the lung, which, combined with the tracheal deviation, points towards a diagnosis of tension pneumothorax, where the increasing pressure in the thoracic cavity pushes the mediastinum to the opposite side.",
