Weight loss follows as difficulty swallowing reduces caloric intake, akin to a person rationing food due to a blocked supply line. Retrosternal pain on swallowing aligns with the mechanical trauma and inflammation caused by Candida plaques, much like a sore throat worsened by swallowing rough food.
