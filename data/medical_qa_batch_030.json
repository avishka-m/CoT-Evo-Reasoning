His 3-week history of headache, fever, and confusion suggests a slow-burning infection, not a sudden bacterial attack. Neck stiffness and photophobia are red flags for meningitis, and in HIV, fungal pathogens like Cryptococcus are the most likely culprits, especially when symptoms persist for weeks. A lumbar puncture is the diagnostic gatekeeper here, revealing elevated opening pressure and India ink-positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that confirms the fungal intruder. Just as a mold grows unnoticed in a damp, dark corner, Cryptococcus quietly invades the central nervous system in immunosuppressed hosts, requiring antifungal agents like amphotericin to dismantle its defenses."
