          "Evaluating these: acute gout typically involves a joint, often the first MTP, and may not cause such diffuse erythema or systemic sepsis; acute Charcot foot usually presents with less pain due to neuropathy and significant deformity, but can be warm and swollen; DVT would not typically cause erythema, warmth, or fever.",
          "The presence of fever and systemic unwellness strongly points to an infection rather than a non-infectious inflammatory condition.",
