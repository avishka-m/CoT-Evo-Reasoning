The 6-week timeline mirrors the 'CMV reactivation window' post-transplant, when immune suppression peaks. Fever and malaise without localized infection are the 'smoke without fire' of a systemic viral process. Mild LFT derangement behaves like a 'liver traffic jam' from CMV hepatitis, not a direct infection. Rising viral load on nucleic acid testing is the smoking gun—a 'biological GPS' tracking CMV replication in the blood."
