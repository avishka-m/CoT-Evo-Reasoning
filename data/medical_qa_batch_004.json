          "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is like a slow-moving tide of lymphocytes flooding the blood and lymph nodes, often asymptomatic until advanced—this patient's high lymphocyte count mirrors a similar quiet invasion. The rubbery lymphadenopathy and palpable spleen are akin to a sponge absorbing excess cells, typical in CLL’s indolent nature. Absolute lymphocytosis (25 x 10⁹/L) far exceeds normal levels, much like a river overflowing its banks, a hallmark of CLL. The non-tender nodes contrast with the tender, reactive nodes of infections, narrowing the diagnosis. Age over 60 aligns with CLL’s epidemiology, as it’s rare in younger adults, similar to how certain cancers cluster in specific age groups. Splenomegaly here acts like a secondary reservoir for the overproduced lymphocytes, compounding the diagnostic picture. Together, these findings form a constellation as recognizable as a signature—CLL is the most likely diagnosis."
