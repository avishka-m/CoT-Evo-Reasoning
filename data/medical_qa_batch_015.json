The new heart murmur signals a 'leaky faucet' in the valves, where bacteria have seeded and caused turbulent blood flow. Splinter haemorrhages are like splinters from a biological splinter gun, tiny blood vessel damage from clot fragments or bacteria circulating like shrapnel. Tender palm lesions (Osler’s nodes) and painless palm nodules (Janeway lesions) act as visible road signs, pointing to immune system battles and micro-emboli in the skin. Fever and malaise are the body’s general alarm bells, warning of systemic infection that demands aggressive intravenous antibiotics to target the 'hidden campsite' of infected heart valves."
